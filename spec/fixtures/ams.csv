TV Dinner,"<p>TV Dinner opened in August 1981 at the former site of the Aquarius Lounge strip club on Peachtree. Founders Finnian Jones and Rosa Phillips initially envisioned the space as a ""video club"" but also hosted music shows and ran a restaurant in the space. TV Dinner was among the first of The American Music Show’s many associations with Atlanta performance and nightlife venues. The show taped episodes here on election night 1981 and the subsequent runoff election. TV Dinner regularly screened TAMS episodes in their space – likely the earliest public screenings of the show outside broadcast TV. Longtime TAMS regulars The Now Explosion held their second live show here. The venue once hosted poet Allen Ginsberg for a spontaneously organized reading (seen in the linked video).

688 Club,"<p>From 1980 to 1986, the legendary 688 Club (named for its address on Spring St and 3rd) hosted hundreds of punk and alternative band performances by the likes of R.E.M., the Ramones, and the Replacements. The American Music Show had a presence here as well.

Frances Hotel,"<p>Originally opened in 1898 as the Farlinger Building, the once chic Frances Hotel had declined considerably by the late 1980s. At this time there were plans to renovate the building to house a new version of The Celebrity Club.

Club Rio,"<p>One of Atlanta’s most celebrated 1980s nightlife spots, Club Rio hosted the likes of David Bowie. It was managed by Michael Krohngold who, with partner Louis Spetrini, later opened Colorbox in Virginia Highland and Velvet downtown.

WRFG,"<p>The American Music Show’s first iteration was in the mid-1970s as a radio show, co-hosted by founders James Bond and Dick Richards on the long-running independent FM station WRFG. The show featured music and character-based parody skits of the kind later refined on the TV show. In one notorious broadcast, Bond (at the time a member of Atlanta’s City Council) locked himself in the control room and repeatedly played the then-current hit “How Long” by Ace. The song’s refrain, “How long has this been going on?,” looped ceaselessly, to many complaints. </p><p>Andy Ditzler</p>",1083 Austin Ave NE,,,,,,,33.762123,-84.352634,

Colorbox,"<p>Located near the corner of Virginia and Highland Avenues, Colorbox was the first club opened by Club Rio manager Michael Krohngold and Louis Spetrini. The American Music Show presented live shows here, and were frequent visitors. This video by Nelson Sullivan is a valuable document of the relatively short-lived venue. In the first half we see RuPaul at home preparing for the show, with show co-founder Dick Richards, cast members Molli Worthington and Rosser Shymanski, and friends. The video’s second half extensively documents Colorbox’s back entrance, tiny dressing room, and the stage and audience area during RuPaul’s performance. Sullivan’s camerawork, while always deft, is especially good here.</p><p>Andy Ditzler</p>",1040 N Highland (at Virginia and Highland),Taking RuPaul to the Colorbox in Atlanta to do a show in 1989,"<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/12pSZfgDIfA?rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Taking RuPaul to the Colorbox in Atlanta to do a show in 1989</p>",,,,,33.782965,-84.354634,
Weekends,"<p>Weekends is a fondly remembered 80s midtown night spot. Around the time of releasing his first Funtone album Sex Freak, RuPaul earned money as a go-go dancer at this bar. The dance floor was lit from below a la Saturday Night Fever. Typically for Nelson Sullivan’s club videos, this clip of Weekends documents both an event in the main space (RuPaul’s go-go dancing near the crowded dance floor) and its offstage component (hanging out with friends in the dressing room, including TAMS co-founder Dick Richards and Larry Tee of the Now Explosion). </p><p>Andy Ditzler</p>",1022 Peachtree St NE,RuPaul - Professional Go-Go Dancer at Weekends Atlanta in the Mid-1980s,"<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/eUfuc_QpkjI?rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>RuPaul - Professional Go-Go Dancer at Weekends Atlanta in the Mid-1980s</p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/pr8v3hMNQDI?rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>RuPaul's Nightclub Act with Trade & Spicey at Weekends Atlanta in 1986</p>",RuPaul's Nightclub Act with Trade & Spicey at Weekends Atlanta in 1986,"<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/pr8v3hMNQDI?rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>RuPaul's Nightclub Act with Trade & Spicey at Weekends Atlanta in 1986</p>",Club -nightlife,,33.783025,-84.384023,
Velvet,"<p>Velvet was one of the most important venues to The American Music Show. It was the second club opened by Michael Krohngold and Louis Spetrini (after Colorbox and before the long-running Tongue and Groove). TAMS presented live shows here nearly once a week, in the upstairs VIP lounge space known as Popcorn – all while Dick Richards continued to release records on Funtone and create the weekly cable TV show.

The Nitery,"<p>A precursor to the Celebrity Club, the Nitery was an important early venue for TAMS-related live shows. Regular TAMS cast member and Atlanta concert booker Tom Zarrilli worked here prior to a stint at the later club. In the first video linked here, RuPaul is interviewed backstage at the Nitery by James Bond as he prepares to perform for the first time with his new band Wee Wee Pole (Robert Burke Warren on bass, Todd Butler on guitar), and we see some of the performance and its aftermath as well. In the second video, Zarrilli performs the song “Destroy Midtown” with the band Attack and Decay at the Nitery’s last show, in protest of the club’s closing due to gentrification. The Nitery building on Ponce has housed Eats restaurant since 1993. </p><p>Andy Ditzler</p>",600 Ponce de Leon Ave NE,RuPaul debuts his Wee Wee Pole band at The Nitery in Atlanta,"<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fq0CoYdAeVM?rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>RuPaul debuts his Wee Wee Pole band at The Nitery in Atlanta</p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/IBJlkFaVgX8?rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Destroy Midtown 1: Weemus Studio (Tom Z protest song against closing the Nitery)</p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/-siiTcpSv7o?rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Wanda Peek Interview at the Nitery Club in Atlanta with her sorry sisters</p>",Destroy Midtown 1: Weemus Studio (Tom Z protest song against closing the Nitery),"<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/IBJlkFaVgX8?rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Destroy Midtown 1: Weemus Studio (Tom Z protest song against closing the Nitery)</p>","<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/-siiTcpSv7o?rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Wanda Peek Interview at the Nitery Club in Atlanta with her sorry sisters</p>","<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/-siiTcpSv7o?rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Wanda Peek Interview at the Nitery Club in Atlanta with her sorry sisters</p>",33.773637,-84.367228,

Basement of Julia Bond (first filming location of TAMS),"<p>The first few years of The American Music Show were taped in the basement of the home of Mrs. Julia Bond, mother of Julian Bond and TAMS co-founder James Bond. In the first year of the show, James was serving on Atlanta's City Council, and had been instrumental in establishing public access cable television in the city. Julian kept an office down the hall from the basement room, and occasionally popped in for an appearance. Mrs. Bond appears in this clip taped in her home for the 1981 Christmas special. Holiday safety tips are provided by Marilyn Singsyme (Molli Worthington) of the Fulton County Cooperative Extension Service. </p><p>Andy Ditzler</p>",West End: Westview Drive near Morehouse and Spelman,,"<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/pHzmJ0MGIQY?rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Holiday Safety Tips for Mrs. Bond by the County Extension Agent</p>",,,,,33.744111,-84.413683,
Home of Dick Richards (2nd filming locations of TAMS),"<p>After James Bond left The American Music Show in the mid-1980s, production moved to the Candler Park home of co-founder Dick Richards, also known as the headquarters of Funtone USA (the recording label on which Richards released LPs by RuPaul, Cocktail Girlz, Now Explosion, and the Pop Tarts). Unlike virtually all other public access television in Atlanta (which was taped in professional studios provided by the cable company), American Music Show episodes were taped at home, allowing for improvisatory freedom and levels of performance inhibited in more professional settings. This video documents the taping of the notorious 1985 New Coke Taste Test episode. Although the video satirizes the ""making-of"" documentary style and includes an ironic voiceover (provided by Molli Worthington), it nonetheless provides a valuable glimpse into the working methods of Dick Richards and crew, and gives a spatial sense of the taping environs.</p><p>Andy Ditzler</p>",Candler Park: Adolphus St between Nelms and Arizona,,"<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/oy9oH9OCiyE?rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>The Official Documentary of ""The American Music Show""</p>",,,,,33.763759,-84.331134,
