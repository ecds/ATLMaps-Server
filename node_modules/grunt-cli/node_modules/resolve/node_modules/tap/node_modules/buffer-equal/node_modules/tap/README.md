This is a mix-and-match set of utilities that you can use to write test
harnesses and frameworks that communicate with one another using the
Test Anything Protocol.

If you don't yet know what TAP is, [you better ask
somebody](http://testanything.org/).

Default Usage:

1. Make a directory.  Maybe call it 'test'.  That'd be nice and obvious.
2. Put a bunch of test scripts in there.  If they're node programs, then
   they should be ".js".  Anything else is assumed to be some kind of shell
   script, which should have a shebang line.
3. `npm install tap`
4. `tap ./tests`

The output will be TAP-compliant.

For extra special bonus points, you can do something like this:

    var test = require("tap").test
    test("make sure the thingie is a thing", function (t) {
      t.equal(thingie, "thing", "thingie should be thing")
      t.type(thingie, "string", "type of thingie is string")
      t.ok(true, "this is always true")
      t.notOk(false, "this is never true")
      t.test("a child test", function (t) {
        t.equal(this, superEasy, "right!?")
        t.similar(7, 2, "ever notice 7 is kinda like 2?", {todo: true})
        t.test("so skippable", {skip: true}, function (t) {
          t.plan(1) // only one test in this block
          t.ok(true, "but when the flag changes, it'll pass")
          // no need to end, since we had a plan.
        })
        t.end()
      })
      t.ok(99, "can also skip individual assertions", {skip: true})
      // end lets it know it's over.
      t.end()
    })
    test("anothe
